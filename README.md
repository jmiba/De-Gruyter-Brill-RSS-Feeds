# De Gruyter/Brill RSS Feeds
Scrapes webpages of De Gruyter/Brill and turns them into RSS feeds.

Feeds currently available:
- Bibliothek - Forschung und Praxis (ahead-of-print) via `bfp/rss.php`, served at [https://www.jensmittelbach.de/bfp/rss.php](https://www.jensmittelbach.de/bfp/rss.php)
- Information - Wissenschaft & Praxis (ahead-of-print) via `iwp/rss.php`, served at [https://www.jensmittelbach.de/iwp/rss.php](https://www.jensmittelbach.de/iwp/rss.php)

Both feeds track the ahead-of-print sections provided by De Gruyter/Brill for their respective journals, parse the article abstracts and metadata, and expose them as RSS 2.0 feeds for easier consumption in feed readers.
